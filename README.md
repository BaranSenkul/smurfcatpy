# Usage
You can modify the source code as you wish, make the text green, adapt it to a new meme, go crazy with it! but please include credit to me (BaranSenkul). Thanks!
# To-do
- Make the program end itself when the music ends
# Troubleshooting
If you are on Windows and it does not play the audio, this is caused by a bug in playsound. You can try downgrading to Python 3.7 or 3.8 ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68917888))
